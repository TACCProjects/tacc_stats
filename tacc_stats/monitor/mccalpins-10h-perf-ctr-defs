Here is a single set of performance counters that could be used to get a
useful overall picture of what is happening on Ranger nodes without
requiring performance counter multiplexing:

                   Counter0      Counter1      Counter2     Counter3
Chip 0, Core 0:    DRAMaccesses  UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 0, Core 1:    HTlink0Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 0, Core 2:    HTlink1Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 0, Core 3:    HTlink2Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS

Chip 1, Core 0:    DRAMaccesses  UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 1, Core 1:    HTlink0Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 1, Core 2:    HTlink1Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 1, Core 3:    HTlink2Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS

Chip 2, Core 0:    DRAMaccesses  UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 2, Core 1:    HTlink0Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 2, Core 2:    HTlink1Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 2, Core 3:    HTlink2Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS

Chip 3, Core 0:    DRAMaccesses  UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 3, Core 1:    HTlink0Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 3, Core 2:    HTlink1Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS
Chip 3, Core 3:    HTlink2Use    UserCycles  DCacheSysFills SSEFLOPS

Definitions:
DRAMaccesses: EventSelect 0E0h, UnitMask 07h (DCT0 only)
HTlink0Use: EventSelect 0F6h, UnitMask 37h (counts all except NOPs)
HTlink1Use: EventSelect 0F7h, UnitMask 37h (counts all except NOPs)
HTlink2Use: EventSelect 0F8h, UnitMask 37h (counts all except NOPs)
UserCycles: EventSelect 076h, OS Mode=0 (counts only user mode cycles)
DCacheSysFills: EventSelect 042h, EventSelect 01h
                (counts DCache fills from beyond the L2 cache)
SSEFLOPS: EventSelect 003h, UnitMask 7F
                (counts single&double, add&multiply&divide&sqrt FLOPs)

If there is good reason to believe that the threads are fairly
homogeneous, then we could fiddle with the "local" counters to get more
precise information.

The event set above only counts user cycles -- I assume that the total
number of cycles can be obtained from the wall time and the system
cycles (including idle loop cycles) can be obtained from the difference.

These choices are for Ranger only -- most other systems have different
DRAM configuration and the Magny-Cours systems have very different
HyperTransport topologies that will require a different approach.
