   handles, and the maximum number of file handles. Linux 2.6 always
   reports 0 as the number of free file handles -- this is not an

   This file contains seven numbers: nr_inodes, nr_free_inodes,

   the system has allocated.  This can be slightly more than inode-max
   because Linux allocates them one page full at a time.
   nr_free_inodes represents the number of free inodes.  preshrink is
   non-zero when the nr_inodes > inode-max and the system needs to
   prune the inode list instead of allocating more. */
